I've mostly abandoned this repo. Instead, look at

# tmux-completion

> Better tab completion for tmux

## Overview

The tmux tab completion provided by [bash-completion]
(http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/) suggests only tmux commands. This
is better than nothing, but if you've entered `tmux attach -t `, it should
really only show you the possible session names. This extension does precisely
that.

In fact, it currently ONLY does that. This extension provides tab completion
for session names when trying to attach to tmux sessions. There are smarter
ways to do this, as well as ways to provide better support for things like
tmux's `session:window` syntax, etc, but that isn't included at the moment.

## Usage

Download this script and source it.

If you installed bash-completion using homebrew
(e.g. `brew install bash-completion`), you can look at your current completions
with ``ls `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d``. You could simply replace the
tmux file listed there with this one, but I wouldn't recommend it. Instead I
keep this one in my dotfiles repository and source it in my `.bash_profile`.
I manually copy the tmux file in this repo and put it in my dotfiles repo in
the `bash_completion.d/` directory, then source it in my `.bash_profile` like
so:

```shell
source ~/dotfiles/bash_completion.d/tmux
```

As the completion function provided by bash-completion evolves, the changes
will have to be manually merged into this repository.

## Attribution

This is a modification of the tmux file included with bash-completion. All hail
bash-completion for giving me the foundation and enumerating all the tmux
commands.

On the other hand, I could be completely wrong about this. I have a different
set in ``ls `brew --prefix bash-completion`/etc/bash_completion.d`` and
``ls `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d``. I might be wrong in thinking that
the tmux script I modified came from the bash-completion guys. Either way,
they run a cool project, so check it out.

## Issues

It might be nice to display windows whenever `-t` is given. This is a common
flag for things like `kill`, `kill-session`, etc. I haven't spent enough time
looking at the tmux commands to know if a session is always an appropriate
target there.
